              <h2 class="Title_boxes">Our work</h2>
              <p class="bettertextboxes"> <br>At GAN, our story began in 2014 with a small team of cubing enthusiasts and engineers determined to challenge the current cubes. From our very first mass-produced model—the GAN 356 Air in 2015—we set out to introduce unprecedented levels of precision, smoothness, and adjustability to the speedcubing world. In 2017, we pioneered magnetic positioning technology, embedding tiny, finely tuned magnets into our cubes to improve stability and orientation feedback; this innovation quickly became an industry standard. That same year, we unveiled our signature honeycomb contact surfaces, replacing flat plastic interfaces with micro-textured panels that deliver consistent turning resistance and allow for finer tension control. Building on this momentum, we launched our springless mechanism in 2019’s GAN 11 M Pro, eliminating coil springs in favor of a streamlined, ball-detent system that further reduced friction and enhanced reliability. Alongside hardware breakthroughs, we expanded our product line to include eco-friendly materials, lightweight “Air” series models, and the GAN Smart Cube, which connects to mobile apps for real-time performance analytics and gamified learning. We’ve also grown our global footprint—establishing a state-of-the-art facility in Shenzhen, sponsoring world championship events, and collaborating closely with top cubers to refine every aspect of our design. Today, GAN stands not just as a manufacturer of high-end puzzles, but as a vibrant community hub where innovation, competition, and sustainability intersect—and we’re proud of every milestone that’s brought us here. Now at this day we will continue to make innovations that will help our community develop. In addition to our technical achievements, we have worked diligently to foster a brand identity that resonates with both casual solvers and elite competitors. Our global ambassador program now spans dozens of countries, empowering young cubers with resources, sponsorships, and opportunities to share their passion. We've also invested heavily in online education, offering video tutorials, app-based coaching, and interactive challenges that make cubing more accessible than ever before. Whether it's designing limited-edition releases or collaborating with other leading minds in the industry, we continue to put the cubing community at the heart of everything we do.</p>

              <h2 class="Title_boxes">Our goals</h2>
              <p class="bettertextboxes">
                <br>At GAN, our journey has always been fueled by a single mission: to redefine the boundaries of what a speedcube can be. As pioneers in the cubing industry, we are not content with simply keeping pace — we strive to lead, innovate, and inspire. Looking to the future, our goals are bold and transformative. We envision a new generation of speedcubes that are not only faster and more precise, but also smarter, more intuitive, and deeply customizable to every cuber’s unique style. Through continued investment in research and development, we aim to integrate cutting-edge technologies such as AI-based turning analysis, smart tension systems, and real-time performance feedback into our cubes. Our goal is to empower cubers — from beginners discovering their first solve, to world champions chasing records — with tools that help them improve faster and compete smarter.

                We also recognize that cubing is more than a competition; it’s a community. That’s why we’re committed to nurturing the global cubing culture by supporting competitions at every level, partnering with local organizers, sponsoring young talents, and creating digital platforms where cubers can connect, compete, and celebrate their achievements. We plan on making our own electonic version of every WCA competition cube, as well as making the old ones better and more accessible. Our GAN Smart Cubes, paired with interactive training apps and gamified learning environments, are only the beginning. We are working toward a future where cubing is more accessible, more social, and more exciting than ever before. Whether you’re solving for fun, training for a title, or exploring cubing as a mental sport, our vision is to meet you there — with products that surprise you, tools that support you, and a brand that grows with you.

                In everything we do, we also keep the planet in mind. As part of our long-term goals, we are exploring sustainable materials, reducing plastic use in our packaging, and seeking eco-friendly production methods. We believe that innovation should not come at the cost of environmental responsibility, and we are determined to be leaders in sustainable product development within our industry. Ultimately, our goal is to evolve GAN into more than a cube manufacturer. We aspire to be a global force for creativity, precision, and passion — shaping the future of cubing while staying true to the spirit of the community that made us who we are. The future of cubing is not just about faster times — it’s about smarter tools, stronger communities, and a shared journey of discovery. And at GAN, we’re just getting started.
